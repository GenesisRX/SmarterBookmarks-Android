# Smart Collections

You can create Smart Collections to organize bookmarks by criteria you specify, such as URL, title, domain, or the date a bookmark was created or modified.

## Create a Smart Collection

You can create a custom Smart Collection to organize bookmarks by the criteria that you specify. Smart Collections cannot contain subfolders; bookmarks cannot be added manually to them. They can only contain bookmarks derived from the criteria you specify.

To create a Smart Collection:

1. Open the app.
2. On the "Collections" tab, click on the "Add rules" button above the "+" button.
3. Enter the name of the Smart Collection.
4. Specify the criteria for including bookmarks in the Smart Collection by adding rules
5. Set a color for the collection if desired
6. Click "Create."

Upon creation, the new Smart Collection will appear in the list of Collections.
